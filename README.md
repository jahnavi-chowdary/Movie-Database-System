# Movie-Database-System
Worked on designing and developing a movie database system similar to IMDB using MySQL for building the database and PHP for connecting the User Interface and Database Server.

We have developed a Movie database system, where the information regarding Actors, Directors, Movies, Reviews, ratings etc will be saved. Going through the project description and websites like “IMDB”, we have identified few entities, found the relationships between them, Constructed the database, scrapped the data from IMDB, Inserted the data into Database and Designed an UI in UBUNTU using mysql and PHP. Detailed information of the process flow in each step of the project is given below.
